# Live Link to [Fullstack](https://fullstack-network.herokuapp.com/)
### 1. Why / Background
  * Fullstack is a web based application that enable users, affiliated with coding boot camps, to organize their curriculum, and increase networking engagement.
 ### 2. What / Objectives / User Stories
  * From design through deployment of the application, this project used the following web development technologies:
    * Server-side: Node.js w/ Express web app framework; MySQL for data persistence w/ Sequelize ORM; Firebase DB for realtime data persistence; Passport for user authentication; WebSocket (TBD) for 2-way interactive communications across server/client 
    * Client-side: React.js library for component based user interface; Material Bootstrap framework for HTML/CSS
  * User Stories, by categorization:
    * Design and develop Wireframe mockup including conceptual single page application with component based views: login, user profile, pet profile, community
    * Design and develop Model schema including ORM (Sequelize) and DB (MySQL, Firebase) configuration
    * Design and develop View on UI including components (React)
    * Design and develop Controller functions including routing and required CRUD operations 
    * The JavaScript Glue PLACEHOLDER: split across team, and organize into actual user stories
 ### 3. How / Design Description
  * The scope of the project fits well into [Agile methodology with Scrum and Kanban frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). Due to sufficient scope and group project, GitHub's built-in tools were used to support project execution:
    * [Projects](https://github.com/OrionAbrams/Project-3/projects/1): Kanban board for documenting user stories and overall progress
    * [Issues](https://github.com/OrionAbrams/Project-3/issues): Issue tracking for user stories, features and bug report
  * Functionality - refer to [video of application user flow](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wj_yyX_CARBAoKz1-fLkkAp_YyxgihzD?usp=sharing):
